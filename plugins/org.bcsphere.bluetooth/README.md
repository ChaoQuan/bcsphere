BC.js
===================================
The BC.js is implemented as an [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) / [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) Plugin for smartphones and tablets.
</br>It only supports Bluetooth Low Energy(BLE) API currently.
  
  * Use this command to install our plugin in your Cordova/Phonegap project: <br/>
    <b>cordova plugin add https://github.com/bcsphere/bluetooth.git </b> <br/>
  * Online document is here: http://www.bcsphere.org/document/ <br/>
  * [BC Explorer](https://github.com/bcsphere/bcexplorer) is a useful tool to show the BLE services structure in device, we hope it will help you to start your development.
  
Features
-----------------------------------
#### Multi-platform development and deployment 
* Your team will not be separated into some smaller teams to develop app for different platforms.
* With the [Apache Cordova](http://cordova.apache.org) / [PhoneGap](http://phonegap.com) Plugin technique,
  you can develop BLE enabled cross-platform mobile apps for e.g. iOS and Android using JavaScript, HTML5 and CSS3.
* If you are a senior Web developer and want to develop a BLE app, BC.js is your best choice, you can use uniform UI code in multi-platform.

#### Effective Utilization of Apache Cordova/PhoneGap Ecosystem
* PhoneGap enables the implementation of many useful plugins such as  [Camera](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_camera_camera.md.html#Camera)/[Accelerometer](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_accelerometer_accelerometer.md.html#Accelerometer)/[Compass](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/edge/cordova_compass_compass.md.html#Compass)...
* You can implements your own [plugins](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/3.3.0/guide_hybrid_plugins_index.md.html#Plugin%20Development%20Guide) based on BC.js for others.
* There is many plugins implements by third party(you can find them on [PlugReg](http://plugreg.com/)), most of them are open-source.

#### Internet of Things
* Both Bluetooth Low Energy and JavaScript are asynchronous by their DNA,which makes them a good match. 
* BLE is good enough for wireless short-range communication. But we won't be limited to BLE API.

Support platforms
-----------------------------------
* Android API 18+ (All devices with Bluetooth Low Energy HW)
* Android API 17+ (Sumsung devices with Bluetooth Low Energy HW)
* Android API 16+ (HTC devices with Bluetooth Low Energy HW, <b>Please note:</b> HTC use shared library to operate BLE device, you should add the 'com.htc.android.bluetooth.le.jar' in the build path manually to support HTC devices.)
* IOS 6.0.1+  (iPhone4S+/iTouch5/iPad3+/iPad-mini/iPadAir)

Backward
-----------------------------------
If your background is Java/C#/C/C++ or HW programming, you may feel confused when use functional programming language(such as javascript) for the first time.
</br>But once you get with it, you will love it, enjoy :)
